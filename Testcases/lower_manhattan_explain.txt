Update: its NOT FINE to miss the last time step...

19 zones (indexed 0, 1, ..., 18)
7 time steps (indexed 0, 1, ..., 6)
6 SOC level (indexed 0, 1, ... 5)
demand expires after 3 times intervals (0, 1, 2, 3)

for travel demand, travel time, order revenue, penalty, we expect 19 start zones * 19 end zones * 7 time steps = 2527 entries
and we have to remove the entries where start zone = end zone, so 19 zones * 7 time steps = 133 entries

travel time is from row 9 to row 2174, so 2166 entries
we are missing 2527 - 2166 = 361 entries
from AI, we are missing all 19 * 19 = 361 entries for time step 6
this is fine as at the last time step, no EV travel (only wrap around)
also it has travelling within same zone, we have to remove that too

travel energy is from row 2177 to row 4342, so 2166 entries
same issue as travel_time.
also travel energy is supposed to be not time dependent... 
since it is dependent on distance travelled

travel demand is from row 4345 to row 6510, so 2166 entries
same issue

order revenue is from row 6513 to row 8678, so 2166 entries

penalty is from row 8681 to row 10846, so 2166 entries

charge speed is 2 soc per time step, ok

num_ports is totally wrong, num ports is defined for per zone (not time specific)

num_EVs is ok

charge_cost is totally wrong, charge cost is defined for per time step (not zone specific)

L_min is ok
