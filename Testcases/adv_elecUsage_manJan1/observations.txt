Problem: why is the electricity_usage flat?
Possible explainations: 
    1) the electrity supply is too low and usage hit some kind of upper bound
    2) charge price is flat


1_increase_elec_supply
    - modified from og.json
    - increase in elec_supplied for all (zone, time) by 1 from 5 to 6
    - purpose: see if charging decisions responds to increased supply
    - result: overall increase in electricty usage, but still same pattern (flat)


2_fluc_price
    - modified from og.json
    - fluctuate charge_cost_low and charge_cost_high st it reflects travel demand
    - highest travel demand across all time steps is assigned to charge_cost_low of 0.5
    - lowest travel demand across all time step is assigned to charge_cost_low of 1
    - all other time steps are scaled in between
    - charge_cost_high is set to be double of charge_cost_low
    - purpose: see if charging decisions correctly responds to price
    - result: no fluctuations in electricity usage despite price fluctuations, same charging decisions as og.json


3_peak_price
    - modified from og.json
    - drastically increased charge_cost_low and charge_cost_high for time step 16 only from 0.2 to 200 and 0.4 to 400
    - purpose: see if charging decisions correctly responds to price
    - result: no charging done at time step 16, suggesting correct charging decisions made
    - maybe price needs to be set higher...


4_fluc_price_agg
    - modified from og.json
    - fluctuate charge_cost_low and charge_cost_high same as 2_fluc_price, but more aggressively
    - scaled between 10 and 100
    - result: only charged when price is very low, between time 5 to 8, no charging at other time step


4_1_fluc_price_agg_need_charge
    - modified from 4_fluc_price_agg
    - increased elec_threshold from 30 to 200 (more realistic)
    - increased L_min from 2 to 6
    - result: still only charge between time 5 to 8, but now up to threshold


5_increase_price
    - modified from og.json
    - increased charge_cost_low and charge_cost_high to 50 and 100 for all time 
    - result: no charging at all
    - we need it to charge...


We now give more reasons for EV to charge
    - reduce num_EV from 10000 to 5000
    - increase L_min from 2 to 7
    - but charging cost cant be set too high, else the optimal decision might be to do nothing (revenue from service cant cover)


5_1_increase_price_need_charge
    - still not charging... service merely decreased

5_2_must_charge
    - increase L_min to 10 (must charge or all idle)
    - surprisingly theres charging, but very little charging (and service)
    - if charging price is set higher, then probably no charging at all.

summary
    - when charge price is set very low (even with fluctuations), charging will be flat
        - we need to increase wholesale_elec_price

    - when charge price is set higher, it will avoid charging entirely or only charge at low price (create fluctuations)
        - we cant have too high wholesale_elec_price
